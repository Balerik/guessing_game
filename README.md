Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This simple Python game allows users to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100.

How to Play

  **Installation:**
        Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from Python's official website.
        Clone this repository or download the number_guessing_game.py file to your local machine.



  **Running the Game:**
        Open a terminal or command prompt.
        Navigate to the directory where you saved guessing_game.py.
        Run the game by executing the following command:

  **Game Rules:**
        The game will generate a random number between 0 and 100.
        You need to guess the number in which it will show you how many tries it took to guess that number.
        After each guess, the game will provide data on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

        

  **Playing Again:**
        After completing a game, you will be asked if you want to play again. Type "yes" to play another round or "no" to exit the game.
